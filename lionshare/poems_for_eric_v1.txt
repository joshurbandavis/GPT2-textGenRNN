voice says :
you are my target , one who wakes groggy
then coffee and cigarette and cigarette
then clutch and gas and class or lab or lecture
and cigarette
currency is a rich man ' s bride
you can be mine for an hour
let me taste your teeth
show me your green
i should be writing the grant
to get the money
for the film i ' m not making
appealing to pockets
deeper than these
cut off jeans
in cut off jeans
i get the money
suit jackets cackling
tie clips and gold teeth
i am writing about
where we will put it
when we get it
maybe a bag
the dollars are droning
here is our hope bank
here is our lets make a movie
here is our would you like to dance
would you like dancing
would you dance
on a friday night
asking the dj to play the wrong song
deposit it like a check
in your pale bone chest ,
marcus with the
long long long long long long long
hairs

focus should be had
by me

here i am sitting in your apartment
waiting for you to come
waiting to touch you mouth with
my hands
my mouth
my teeth on your back
my hands on your perfect ass
your hands grabbing my chest threatening
to pull my heart right out through my mouth
i wanna be the dance you want
on a friday or a thursday or a monday night
in your messy apartment or my unmade bed
or on a couch in a university lab or on the floor anywhere .

carl is asleep at the foot of my bed
he lays against my legs
i have wanted so much
to be wanted i keep collecting
things * in hopes
i am waiting to be ready i collect
and plan for some future when i ' ll be good
enough , when i ' ll know enough or have enough
to deserve to be wanted
in a dream a man grabbed
me from behind and i couldn ' t
get free in the same dream we were looking
out a window your holding me i asked
if you were cold you said no and then
we were on a rooftop softly kissing
i have five pairs of glasses ,
all of which are broken in some way i can ' t
wait . i can ' t wait .
i want to be a good listener . i want to be helpful .
i want you to see how good you are . it ' s easy
to see if you ' re not you . exactly once
i fell through the ice in a frozen pond . i don ' t know why i ' m so surprised
when i learn what i already knew
out here just hoping to be seen
and knowing that we ' re all homeless
knowing that sex feels good to everyone
and remembering all the hurt i ' ve caused
i know you are not sleeping
even in dreams i feel you aching
it says nothing of your love that i am this way
open like a window
and maybe you were hoping for
a load bearing beam
the garage caves in again
i didn ' t mean to weigh on you
i only meant to lift you to my lips
but i drink so loudly
lapping and lapping
the cups in the sink
the bottles line the west wall of the kitchen
you say the clutter makes you
anxious
you wince
i wince
i can feel you
i can feel you
steady and always
the way you
slow down while i am
rushing through the pavement
you say , hey
and wait
for me to wait
and i stop to let you balance me
your own peculiar magic
i want to press into you for a long time
i need to know very little
but this
is my curse - - waiting
the moon
you are closer a display of payphones because what we ' re all homeless
knowing that sex feels good to everyone
and remembering all the hurt i ' ve caused
i know you are the lamppost who forgot he was lightening
watching over the parked cars of your workshop — little lever , small screw , a zip tie waiting for it ’ s purpose
the way you move through shadows
away from the rim of last week ’ s coffee cup
and yesterday ’ s cigarette still burning in the ashtray on the front porch
mocking you
i have not forgotten your gold tooth grin
and how you are working in a single direction
and how lonely it is to be a south without a north
and what it means to be held by a place you call home
not searching the wood paneling and milk white bones waiting
for something to feel settled
or for you to settle into it
when you woke
turning down a hallway
wondering under which fluorescent tile
you last stashed your glowing
even dimly lit , i love you
even flickering and threatening darkly
even then , you know ,
i love you .
i know your heart hurts sometimes because my heart
hurts , because we are tied together with string like a kids '
tin can telephone that we all know but have probably never
seen in anything but an old cartoon but that also probably
doesn ' t work very well as an actual telephone . i ' m shouting
into this fucking can and hoping you can hear me , hoping
that when i say " your eyes shine like salt mines " you don ' t
hear " these shoes are worn and tired like my face " and
when i whisper " this love is keeping me alive " i hope
you hear me at all . when this string is at it ' s thinnest , when
it ' s stretched as tight and as far as it can go , that ' s just
when we should be able to hear each other best . i want
you to know i ' m listening . i ' m listening
because i don ' t know where
we are going or what this will look like
next week or next year , but today you were there for me
when i needed you , and i was and am grateful .

 we ' re out here without shoes in this field ,
naked in the switchgrass with the mice and mosquitoes
chewing up our ankles . we ' re out here this morning miles
from each other , but close , and these mice are
teething on our toes and these mosquitoes are
nursing on our blood because we have enough
to spare , because we ' ve been doing this for
as long as we can remember and before then .
and this is just fine . and all of this
is exactly what i want .
i should be writing the grant
to get the money
licking you
gently
before submitting to the panel . . .
here i am sitting in your apartment
waiting for you to come
waiting to touch you mouth with
my hands
my mouth
my teeth on your back
my hands on your perfect ass
your hands grabbing my chest threatening
to pull my heart right out through my mouth
i wanna be the dollars hidden in your bag ,
your bank of care and lust and listening .
i wanna be the dance you want
on a friday or a thursday or a monday night
in your messy apartment or my unmade bed
or on a couch in a university lab or on the floor anywhere .
i wanna be your perfect slut .

on the other side of my legs now eyes half open
he is dreaming i think
