How to Write About Ghosts
BY: poet_textgen_temp_1_05_02_02

Death is a narrative poem.
It was windless, like a fist;
And the shape of a forgotten paradises.
When the time of the living rattle beautiful bells
like the wind and the heart pounding,
That is when men bled women drop dead.

I'll show you: eat an orange, stumble into the car,
make a glass dress  with these strange fists.
My god understands how she blew through liquor,
as if to poke a stick into the sea were to seduce 
the boy (any boy) who could be possessed.
Sucking in my eyes, I was a river shooting stars. 

But your heart is a stick in this throat, baby,
and when your mouth is pure chains,full of stars, 
and the blue rattles from the light 
In the silent, surely, something breaks, 
The way I broke your heart
along the kitchen floor: sterile,
each mouth opened with precision,
and the sound of my skin, Death.

I only want something that someone  else wants:
And what I want is water that covers lovers and the dead.
Which is how you could have been a man 
Born hard as a woman and walk out the window. 
to become the water covered love,
become the fist dressed liquor, 
become the long loved dead.
