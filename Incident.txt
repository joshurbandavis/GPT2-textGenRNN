Incident
BY: poet_gentext_20190421_013038

Swallowed by scarred flowers, cut to the rain,
the falling of the sun and the string and sighs 
that are on the other side of the past.

The wooden days of summer scratch, â€¨
dress, and hold the tools of dead men,
and the roast being pulled off the soul is less in need
of mending memories and more in need 
of the vines inside it, like a wilderness.

And O God, I snapped out of my brown secret sound 
and screamed Like a brilliant punch-drunk bell, 
like diamond rain at midnight, still hungry,
still scratch, and sewn from seed into names.

And from the names you grew a song,
cracked like lightning, 
white heaped diamond clouds
while the sky is tilted
on a stone;

So sing, to those whose name you've forgotten:
The window is staring, open for the night.
For the cloudless sky, the sleepers,
the bursts from your eyes,
From the  song slipping out of the body.
It may come totally ragged.
You can go from one space, one stone, 
the sound a name makes going
far away from me.
