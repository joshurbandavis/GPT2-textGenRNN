Creation Myth
By: poet_gentext_temp_1_1_05_02

i love this sadness , 
i ’ m the one on my hands & knees , 
searching for the lost keys , 
in a moonlit locked room,
and you just wait:
the way you stood 
in the dark blue 
could be a poem .

"I swallowed the key"
says the moon.
The moon could be a man, 
who speaks like a child. 
I hold my hands like a bow, 
held it over his lips, 
and looked quietly down into his mouth.  
I saw the time the day begins. 
Its home: a deep blue.
The same you: a deep blue.

I have seen dust in this mouth,
the way the sea stares through me. 
I straddle the seas, 
The waste remains, 
the moon does not smile,
The sea scraped the black sky. 
I want to be a mirror in the grave, 
so you look at me to see the sky.

And still, the moon can be a man, 
and the stars are still salt in his mouth.
The man should be the moon 
the woman should be the key.
The deep blue should be a little grave. 
A poem should be so much more 
than the stars holding still 
while I speak because there is no disaster 
the moon's mouth can't swallow.
