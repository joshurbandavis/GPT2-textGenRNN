# Text Generation Projects Using GPT-2 and textGenRNN

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Text Generation Projects** collection! This repository houses a series of projects that revolve around text generation using generative recurrent neural networks and GPT-2. Whether you're interested in fine-tuning models, training from scratch, or exploring immersive theater projects, you've come to the right place.

## Key Projects

### 1. Fine-Tuning GPT-2

- Explore notebooks for fine-tuning the GPT-2 model to generate text tailored to your specific needs.

### 2. Training from Scratch

- Dive into the world of training GPT-2 and TextGenRNN models from scratch. Create your own text generation masterpieces.

### 3. Immersive Theater Projects

- Discover auxiliary files for two immersive theater projects: Lionshare and Fauxbituary. See how text generation can enhance storytelling experiences.

### 4. AI Poetry Slam

- Poems generated by this system have been used in several "human vs AI poetry slam" competitions between 2015 and 2020. Explore the creative outcomes of these competitions.
